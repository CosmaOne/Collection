A small Greenhouse System with two (2) timed relays and an internal clock. They system uses an LCD to display information. A 4-digit security password login is also included.

After successfully login, the user can set the turn on/off times for the two (2) relays, view their ON/OFF status or set-up the main internal clock used for timing. All values are stored in EEPROM so in the event of a system reset due to external power issues, the system doesn't lose its settings.

Because this project was originally created for testing LCDs, the system creates custom characters for the LCD and uses them during the system's bootup with a small animation.
