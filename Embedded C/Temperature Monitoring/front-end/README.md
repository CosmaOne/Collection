Remote Access & Control of Automated Systems

This is the front-end of a web app for connecting with a ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module and receiving data from it.
This particular application receives data from a NTC Thermistor connected to an ATmega8 microcontroller (back-end), which in turn is connected to a ESP module.

The module connects through Wi-Fi to the local network and from there it can be accessed locally and externally (after adding the exceptions in the router).

This demonstrates the possibilities of remote accessing an automated system, for example:

1) Controlling house apliances (lights, oven, water heater, boiler, garage door, etc.)
2) Monitoring/Controlling the sensor data (temperature, humidity, etc.) in industrial enviroments (refridgerators, ventilation system, greenhouses, etc.)
