This application is a Hyper Terminal for use in Serial Communication between devices.

It was originally designed and used for communicating with an ATmega8 microcontroller using an RS232 serial port.
I was let down in some of the more popular choices for Hyper Terminals like "PuTTy", because of their overcomplicated design. At least for me.

I wanted something so that I can start communicating within two clicks and all the options in the same screen without clicking on menus, sub-menus ... etc.
One extra feature of this hyper terminal is the ability to send and receive data in HEX format. So, instead of the ASCII represantions, you get the Hexadecimal ones.

That is useful when you're trying to identify individual bytes in the stream that might not appear in text form (null or carriage return characters).
